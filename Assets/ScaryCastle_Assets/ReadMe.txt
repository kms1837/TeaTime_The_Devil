
Thank you for purchasing this asset!

Here, you get two prefabs: Castle_Pieces and Castle_Single

Castle_Single is a whole castle in one mesh and it uses one diffuse and one normalMap texture for everything. It's great if you won't show this asset from short distance. If you get too close, pixels will show because of the texture size (2048).

Castle_Pieces is the same castle but composed out of 5 meshes, each using it's own diffuse and normalMap textures. It's great if ou plan on getting close to the castle because since there are 5 textures, there is more pixel-detail per surface.

Both prefabs have meshes for self-illuminated window surfaces. You can activate or deactivate (or even delete) each window to your liking. It's great for night-scenes.

All the diffuse and normalMap textures are 2048x2048 pixels large and in PSD format.
Diffuse textures have AmbientOcclusion (AO) layer added in Photoshop which you can turn off if you don't want it or if you plan on baking lighting yourself.

I hope this Castle is just what you need to make your game just the way you wanted.
